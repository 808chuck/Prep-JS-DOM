#Document Object Model (DOM)
When a web page loads, the browser creates a DOM of the page.  Think of it like an organizational chart for the entire web page.  Everything found on the web page (i.e. text, elements, links, style attributes) have a spot in this organizational chart.  

The DOM is important for accessing and changing the contents of the current web page.  Javascript can be used to access and manipulate things in the organizational chart:

1.  Create new HTML elements and attributes
2.  Change all HTML elements
3.  Change all HTML attributes
4.  Change CSS styles
5.  Remove exisiting HTML elements and attributes
6.  React to exisiting HTML events 
7.  Create new HTML events
